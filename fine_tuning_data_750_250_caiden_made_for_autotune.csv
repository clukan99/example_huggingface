P: Hi, Doctor. I've been having these headaches that make my vision blurry and distorted. 

D: I see that you have a history of migraines, Lucy. Based on your symptoms, it seems like you might be experiencing another one.

P: Yes, that's right. And my appetite has increased a lot lately too. It's making me feel very hungry all the time.

D: Those are common symptoms of migraines. Additionally, you might experience visual disturbances such as auras or flashes of light.

P: Yes, that's also happening to me. It's really frustrating and uncomfortable.

D: I understand, Lucy. To help manage your migraines, I would recommend practicing meditation and reducing your stress levels. You can also use polarized glasses when you're outside to help reduce glare and brightness.

P: Ok, I'll try that. And what about medication?

D: I would prescribe Fiorinal for you to take as needed for your migraines. Make sure to take it at the first sign of a headache to get the best results.
